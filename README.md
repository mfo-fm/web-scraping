Web Scraping: this is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing the HTML or XML content of those pages, and extracting relevant information. The extracted data can then be stored, analyzed, or used for various purposes in this case, I am just fetching quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com/ and just printing. 
In summary scraping a web page follows this breakdown: Fetching Web Pages--> Parsing HTML Content--> Extracting Data--> Processing Data--> Storing Data.
I would like to explain the python code for this web scraping
