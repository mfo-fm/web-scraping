Web Scraping: this is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing the HTML or XML content of those pages, and extracting relevant information. The extracted data can then be stored, analyzed, or used for various purposes in this case, I am just fetching quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com/ and just printing.

In summary scraping a web page follows this breakdown: 
Fetching Web Pages--> Parsing HTML Content--> Extracting Data--> Processing Data--> Storing Data.

I would like to explain the python code for this web scraping (web_scraping.py).

The scripts generally extracts quotes and the authors from quotes.toscrape.com.

•	import requests: This line imports the requests library, which is used to make HTTP requests to websites.

•	from bs4 import BeautifulSoup: This line imports the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 (Beautiful Soup 4) library. BeautifulSoup is a powerful Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.

•	url = 'http://quotes.toscrape.com/': This line defines the URL of the website we want to scrape, which is Quotes to Scrape in this case.

•	response = requests.get(url): This line sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and stores the response in the response variable.

•	if response.status_code == 200: This line checks if the response status code is 200, which indicates that the request was successful and the webpage was found.

•	soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser'): This line creates a BeautifulSoup object soup by passing the HTML content of the webpage (response.text) and the parser to use ('html.parser').

•	quotes = soup.find_all('div', class_='quote'): This line uses BeautifulSoup's find_all() method to find all <div> elements with the class 'quote'. These elements contain the quotes, authors, and tags.

•	if quotes:: This line checks if any quotes were found on the webpage.

•	for quote in quotes: This line starts a loop to iterate over each quote found on the webpage. 

•	text = quote.find('span', class_='text').text: This line extracts the text of the quote by finding the <span> element with the class 'text' inside the current quote element.

•	author = quote.find('small', class_='author').text: This line extracts the name of the author by finding the <small> element with the class 'author' inside the current quote element.

•	tags = [tag.text for tag in quote.find_all('a', class_='tag')]: This line extracts the tags associated with the quote by finding all <a> elements with the class 'tag' inside the current quote element. It uses a list comprehension to extract the text of each tag.

•	print(f'{text}'), print(f'-> {author}') : This line prints the quote text and author name in a formatted string.

•	print(f'Tags: {", ".join(tags)}'): This line prints the tags associated with the quote, separated by commas.
•	else: This line executes if no quotes were found on the webpage.
•	print("No quotes found."): This line prints a message indicating that no quotes were found.
•	else: This line executes if the HTTP request fails or the status code is not 200.
•	print('Failed to retrieve data from quotes.toscrape.com.'): This line prints a message indicating that the data retrieval failed.
